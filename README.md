## Overview

Our method yields superior and temporally consistent motion estimation. It can be observed that our method yield graph (green
curve) significantly closer to the ground truth acceleration graph (black curve) compared to existing methods [1](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Choi_Beyond_Static_Features_for_Temporally_Consistent_3D_Human_Pose_and_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08534), and [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01524) (result inferred on
unseen test video from [Human3.6M dataset](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6682899)).
